Hi! I'm Caspar Primke and I am currently a third year at the University of Gerogia!

I am a computer science major who is up for any new challenge.
I like to play video games, read books, workout, and play board games. 
Learning how to use github has been really fun and hopefully I will be able to continue using it at a future job!
